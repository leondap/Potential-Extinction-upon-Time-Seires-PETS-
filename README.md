# Potential-Extinction-upon-Time-Seires-PETS

Monitoring is essential for detecting trends and to identify species deserving conservation efforts. However, in most regions and areas, monitoring scheme did not exist or they have been only recently implemented. For this reason it is fundamental to evaluate the degree to which a community appears eroded in time as a possible outcome of two possible causes: 1) species that went extinct; 2) lack of recent occurrence data providing a false signal of extinction.
We implemented an index to calculate Potential Extincion upon Time Series (PETS) at community level and provided the pets function to calculate it.
